What is MongoDB?

>MongoDB is powerful, flexible,scalable and NoSQL(Not Only SQL) database 
that is widely used for storing large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. 

Unlike traditional relational databases (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL), which use tables and 
rows to store data, MongoDB stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format 
using BSON (Binary JSON) format.
    
>Document-Oriented Storage:
    MongoDB stores data in documents. A document is a set of key-value pairs, 
    and it can include nested structures (arrays, embedded documents, etc.).
    Documents are similar to JSON objects but stored in BSON (Binary JSON), 
    which allows for more efficient storage and includes additional data types 
    like Date and Binary.

>Example of a person document in MongoDB:
    {
        "name": "suman",
        "gender": "Female",
        "location":"Mysore"
    }

What is mongoengine?

>MongoEngine is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB in Python. It provides 
a high-level abstraction over the raw pymongo driver, allowing you to work with MongoDB 
in a more Pythonic way, using Python objects and classes instead of raw queries and 
BSON documents.

An ODM is similar to an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) but for NoSQL databases like 
MongoDB. While ORMs are used to map Python objects to relational database tables 
(e.g., SQLAlchemy for relational databases), ODMs map Python objects to MongoDB documents.

Step1: Create a virtual environment in VS Code 
    >Create your project folder and open this folder in VScode
    >Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P
    >Search for and select Python: Create Environment
    >Choose Venv as the environment type
    >Select an interpreter python version from the list
    >A notification will appear showing the progress of the environment creation
    >The environment folder will appear in your workspace (.venv)
    >Use the Python: Select Interpreter command to select your new environment

Step2: Install dependencies using pip
    $pip install mongoengine 

Step3:> Open MongoDBCompass connect to db click on connect button.
    
Step4: execute app.py file
    $python app.py 

Step5: Test CRUD operations using menudriven program.
